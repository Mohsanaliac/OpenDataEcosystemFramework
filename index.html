                  <li>In OD Ecosystems, value is seen as multifaceted and dependent on the dynamics of user engagement, circularity, inclusivity, and skill-based development within open data systems:	The complexity of ‘valuing’ open data arises from the various stages in the open data usage process, which range from collection and storage to analysis and sharing. Each stage presents unique requirements and risks that need to be managed to maintain the data's utility and integrity while ensuring responsible data practices that consider privacy, equity, and accountability (S. G. Verhulst, 2021). In the open data ecosystems proposal, the concept of value is approached from a broader, ecosystem-oriented perspective rather than merely traditional use-value.</li>

                  <li>Boundary-making in relation to OD Ecosystems: To define the boundaries of an OD ecosystem, actors should be aware of the socio-technical conditions where their interactions with other actors take place. These conditions refer on one hand to social components such as historical, geographical aspects, social and cultural norms, organization norms and community affiliations, as well as practices, traditions, personal motivations and values. On the other hand, the technical aspects include soft and hard data infrastructures, interoperability practices, standards, laws and regulations. Ecosystem mapping can be done using tools from the discipline of design thinking and theoretical principles from the discipline of information visualization and communication.</li>

                  <li>In terms of practical implementation, legal frameworks for open data initiatives could refer to CARE principles in addition to the FAIR principles for data quality management. (ODECO, 2023). These CARE Principles do not focus only on inherent qualities of data that enable more sharing and re-use, but also focus on power differentials. As a result, CARE Principles also focus on realising collective benefit from open datasets, as well as ensuring commitment to ethics. (Carroll et al., 2020). There are examples of CARE principles being translated into the design and implementation of open data initiatives - such as the Open Data Mekong project. (Chung & Chung, 2019; DCPC, 2024).                   </li>

              <li>Circular
                <ol>
                  <li>Commitments to provide continuous and adequate funding for maintaining and developing open data infrastructure and support ought to be institutionalized, for example, through supranational, national, or local laws. Conversely, open data has to be considered as an infrastructure (like roads, clean water, etc.) and be accounted for in the tax policy design that, at the same time, does not disincentivize companies from continue using open data.</li>
                  <li>Some restructuring, streamlining, and coordination of open data management and provision may be necessary within and across government agencies to save (transaction) costs as open data providers further. At the same time, it may also be worth coordinating with other agencies that are not necessarily open data providers to implement contractual obligations with third-party vendors that collect data through their government-funded projects/undertakings to give such data to the government free of charge (including augmented data on top of initially government open data), so that (some of) the data can then be provided as open data. This saves the government from (re)collecting the data.                    </li>
                  <li>One possible way to recuperate some of the costs of providing open data is for government agencies to also provide value-added services based on open data at fees. This involves revisiting, clarifying, and potentially amending existing laws related to government-market roles and competition.                   </li>
                  <li>Government agencies should be obligated to use open data whenever it is available and to inform open data providers of any errors in the data. This saves costs for them as open data users as well as to open data providers in ensuring data quality.                   </li>
                  <li>Tax incentives may be worth considering to entice companies and citizens to contribute to open data initiatives as funders or data providers. The case of the Wikimedia Foundation and OpenStreetMap Foundation being granted tax-deductible status in some countries, where companies and citizens who donate to these organizations can claim tax deductions, is a good example to consider for other open data initiatives.                   </li>
                  <li>Governments should recognize that they are no longer the only open data providers. Hence, they should consider supporting citizen-generated or crowdsourced open data projects, such as OpenStreetMap, by financially supporting or contributing their own data to these projects. At the same time, governments can also leverage open data from these projects as one of their data sources. This may lead to more cost-sharing in open data initiatives within the ecosystem.                   </li>
                  <li>A purpose-driven approach, rather than a user-driven one, can enhance open data ecosystems to better reflect the understanding of social value. Purpose-directed models establish clear goals, usually concentrating on encouraging responsible data usage while advancing societal benefits, such as improved healthcare and environmental sustainability.                  </li>

             Understanding the key drivers that propel the open data ecosystem forward.</p>
            <img src="images/OD ecosystem drivers.png">
            <br/>
            <b>User-Driven</b>
            <P style="text-align: justify;">Most existing OD systems are neither user-driven nor balance demand-supply matching. Although users' role is assumed to be critical for the success of OD ecosystems, suppliers drive current ecosys-tems (Gascó-Hernández et al., 2018; Sieber & Johnson, 2015; Van Loenen, 2018; Crusoe et al., 2019). This means that provisioning data from governments to end users is often made through a one-way data portal or platform (Evans & Campos, 2013) without differentiating between various types of users (including cross-border users) or providing data in the way that the data supplier perceives as satisfying (see European Commission, 2020c). Even more, the published data may have no value or are not directly usable (Rhind, 2014). OD providers do not close (enable) the feedback loop – a mech-anism for demand-supply matching – and hence are unaware of the actual use and users of their data, and what data and in what form the users need the data to create value (Harrison et al., 2012;
                Susha, 2015). That is, they only know that opening datasets increases “usage numbers”, i.e. number of downloads (van Loenen et al, 2018).
            </P>
            <b>Circular</b>
            <P style="text-align: justify;">Existing OD systems are often linear. In linear OD ecosystems, OD users typically capture value without adding value to the system themselves. At the moment, only very few stakeholders in the ecosystem profit from OD, and usually, the ones who profit are not the ones who invested most effort, time, and money (Pollock, 2011; Welle Donker & Van Loenen, 2018). As a result of this unfair distribution of value in the OD ecosystem, stakeholders may be reluctant to participate. An OD eco-system is circular (BSI Group, no year) when data is opened by data providers and then processed so that intermediaries, value-adding resellers, and enrichers can keep processed data in use for as long as possible. Users extract the maximum value from derived data/services. Finally, closing the cycle, stakeholders provide additional value to the ecosystem (Alexopoulos et al., 2014). For exam-ple, they can deliver value-added products based on the OD or evaluate data usage processes with data providers (Charalabidis, 2016). The necessary type of ecosystem is circular in nature, building upon a complex network of value generated by different participants that are creating valuable in-formation and products and services. However, note that a circle that is too small can harm circular OD systems because prosumers are then focused on serving data to themselves.</P>
            <b>Inclusive</b>
            <P style="text-align: justify;">Many current OD systems are exclusive. Research and practice mainly focus on a minimal selec-tion of OD providers and user groups, namely governments as data providers and companies as OD re-users. At the same time, many more stakeholders exist (Van Loenen et al., 2018). Consequently, government data and non-government data (e.g., from businesses, citizens, researchers, and others) are often not integrated and do not cross borders. Moreover, not all stakeholders (e.g., data provid-ers, intermediaries, value-adding resellers, enrichers, facilitators, end-users) from any nature (com-mercial, government, scientific, citizen) participate in OD ecosystem processes (eu2020.de, 2020; Eu-ropean Commission 2020).</P>
            <b>Skill-based</b>
            <P style="text-align: justify;">Existing OD systems usually depend on best effort. There is a lack of skilled people to use OD. Re-search indicates that many businesses and governments do not have the knowledge and skills to decide on and implement effective strategies of making the best use of their data (Barbero et al., 2018; Davies et al., 2019). This is already reflected in the digital gap within the EU public administra-tions and the significant variations in the quality of digital public services and which is heavily in-fluenced by the discrepancies in digital skills and competences (Chinn et al., 2020; European Union, 2020). There are currently not enough people who have the right data skills (European Commission, 2020b; IDC & Open Evidence, 2017). This problem is likely to get even worse in the future (Deloitte, 2017). Despite the relevance of soft skills (Laker and Powell, 2011) when considering technological changes (Snape, 2017), the skills required are a higher education degree in economics, mathematics, physics, or other relevant scientific disciplines, plus familiarity with the industry concerned (Econ-omist Intelligence Unit, 2012). The combination of all these skills is difficult to obtain (Deloitte, 2017).</P>

This can then enable inter-organisational cultures, as well as potentially foster partnerships. These organisational cultures can also serve as motivations for actor groups to engage in open data initiatives. Such cultures can be cultivated using formal institutions like legal frameworks, together with informal approaches to creating shared understandings among the various open data actors.</li>

                    <li>Supporting communities of OD Ecosystems:	To support the formation of communities around the use of open data, actors of the OD Ecosystem should be knowledgeable of the purposes and practices that can be affected by open data. Shared purposes typically revolve around public and/ or local concerns, therefore they directly affect citizens, local communities or digital communities. Communities of practice typically form when experts, practitioners and academics explore societal problems by developing knowledge, tools, practices that address those problems. Research done in the field of participatory design focuses on empowering communities of shared purpose, while disciplines such as data science and engineering, engineering design, computer science typically form communities of practice around open data.                    </li>

                  <li>The EU’s Implementing Regulation on High-Value Datasets (2023/138), while fostering innovation by prioritizing economically valuable datasets, needs to be applied more equitably. Critics highlight that focusing on efficiency and market productivity marginalizes citizens' rights and participation. To address this, equitable implementation could involve expanding dataset categories to include social data, as seen in India's focus on poverty alleviation or Glasgow’s project on well-being indicators, ensuring that open data serves not only economic growth but also societal needs and inclusivity.</li>
                  <li>Legal institutions should focus on ensuring commercial actors in open data initiatives prioritize the public interest. Courts can establish guidelines for open data intermediaries, as illustrated by the ECHR ruling in Satakunnan Markkinapörssi Oy v. Finland, which restricted companies from misusing publicly accessible tax data for sensationalism instead of fostering meaningful public debate. Additionally, public procurement frameworks can be adapted to require private service providers to share data generated during public service delivery in open, machine-readable formats. Barcelona’s use of “data sovereignty clauses” in procurement contracts offers a strong model for balancing commercial involvement with public accountability.</li>
                  <li>Private law instruments, such as open licenses, can promote equitable value creation in the open data ecosystem by addressing power imbalances and fostering ethical data sharing. While open licenses like Creative Commons and Open Database Licenses were originally designed to counter copyright restrictions and encourage re-use, new challenges like data privacy, competition, and data colonialism necessitate their reimagining. For example, the University of Pretoria’s Data Science Law Lab has developed a data license for African language datasets, requiring stronger share-alike obligations from re-users in developed countries, ensuring value flows back to the Global South and countering data extractivism.                  </li>

                  <li>Incentivising open data sharing by open data holders in ODE through governance strategies: An approach to steer the behaviour of non-government data holders towards open data through a governance strategy.</li>

                  <li>Coordinating functions should be discharged by public administrations to bring together open data providers and open data users to openly discuss their needs: "Public administrations should routinely consult with open data users and providers from the citizenry, the private sector and the public sector to understand evolving needs of these stakeholders and undertake open data initiatives that respond to these needs. Public administrations should also provide funding to collaborative open data initiatives, which can then serve a coordinating function. At the same time, coordinating functions can also lead to open data ecosystems in unexpected ways. For instance, the UK mapping agency – Ordnance Survey – did create large geographic datasets, but many open data users were dissatisfied that these datasets were not freely distributed. This led to the birth of OpenStreetMap (see https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/History_of_OpenStreetMap) – an open platform for crowd-source geospatial data, which could be considered an example of a sustainable open data ecosystem. Future research can explore mechanisms for non-governmental actors to discharge coordinating functions.</li>
                  <li>Encouraging participation and shared decision-making: To encourage polycentricity through participation and collaborative decision making in the OD Ecosystem, actors with more power such as institutions, organizations, communities that represent the status quo should ensure that those typically with less power such as citizens, students, research participants as well as less represented and disadvantaged groups are being actively encouraged to communicate their feedback, needs and concerns, as a first step. Moreover, they should be empowered to actively contribute to the creation of strategies and plans, practices and assessments, products and services. The discipline of (critical) data studies provides tools, approaches and theoretical concepts that challenge existing power structures and propose more just and equitable alternatives.</li>
                  <li>Partnerships should be formed between public administrations / international organisations and other civic open data user groups to co-develop open data initiatives, which can prompt contributions from other actors.</li>

                    are often scarce, so to support NGOs' projects long-term, more financial cooperation is needed.  4. Promote training to improve open data awareness for NGOs that lack it.

                  <li>Making available integrated datasets from diverse fields for users with diverse needs is needed: The necessity for integration of
                    data and accessibility feasible for user groups with varying needs (e.g., visual impairment, dyslexia, and others) </li>
                  <li>Portability of infrastructure in the open data domain: The portability of infrastructure will help transfer the knowledge of OD infrastructure to another organisation</li>
                  <li>Community Portal for interaction	"The data portal should provide a place where users can connect with other users in a community,based on similar interests.</li>
                  <li>Designing an ecology of interoperable projects 	To focus on interoperability and data portability and have a broad understanding of these concepts. In particular, efforts for interoperability should encompass technical interoperability (through, for example, semantic and syntactic interoperability of open data systems/portals and through standardised formats for (open) data, as also noted in the empirical data collected) as well as generative interoperability (through adoption of policies aimed at nurturing public spaces for decision-making in relation to open data needs and challenges). Support should be provided to regulatory measures aimed at broad interoperability and portability, through advocacy and political action.                  </li>

                  <li>Establish a national or supra-national consortium for open data sharing by non-public organizations. Among other things, this consortium could develop and maintain non-proprietary technical infrastructure for open data sharing. The consortium may be governed by a committee composed of public, private, and civil sector stakeholders that facilitate collective decision-making on various technical and non-technical aspects. The consortium and its infrastructure may be supported by joint multi-stakeholder financial cooperation based on agreed terms.</li>
