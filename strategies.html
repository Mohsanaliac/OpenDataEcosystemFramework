              At the same time, coordinating functions can also lead to open data ecosystems in unexpected ways. For instance, the UK mapping agency – Ordnance Survey – did create large geographic datasets, but many open data users were dissatisfied that these datasets were not freely distributed. This led to the birth of OpenStreetMap (see https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/History_of_OpenStreetMap) – an open platform for crowd-source geospatial data, which could be considered an example of a sustainable open data ecosystem. Future research can explore mechanisms for non-governmental actors to discharge coordinating functions."</td>
